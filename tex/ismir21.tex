\section{Introduction}

With the advent of reasonably large labeled datasets such as the VGMIDI dataset \cite{ferreira_2019}, it became feasible to investigate AAC \cite{williams2015investigating} as a problem of steering the probability distribution of neural LMs towards a target emotion. Given a neural LM $L$, a prior sequence of music tokens $x = [x_1, \dots, x_{t-2}, x_{t-1}]$, a target emotion $e$, and a music emotion classifier $E$, the problem consists of decoding the $L$'s output layer to predict the next tokens $x' = [x_t, x_{t+1}, \cdot, x_n]$ with the guidance of the classifier $E$ in order to maximize the likelihood of $x'$ having the target emotion $e$. The previous chapter presented SBBS, a decoding strategy that approaches this problem based on the beam search algorithm. This chapter presents a new decoding strategy to approach this problem based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Multiple search iterations are executed at decoding time to build a distribution of node visits that steers the LM distribution towards a target emotion. During the search, the value of each node is computed using a music emotion classifier, and the Predictor Upper Confidence for Trees (PUCT) is used to decide the order of node expansions. The next token in the sequence is decided by sampling from this new distribution.

The search is performed over the space learned by a Music Transformer LM \cite {huang2018music} with the unlabelled pieces of the VGMIDI dataset. The number of unlabelled pieces of the VGMIDI dataset has been extended as part of this work from 728 to 3,640. Similar to the works presented in Chapter \ref{ch:ismir19} \cite{ferreira_2019} and Chapter \ref{ch:aiide20} \cite{ferreira2020computer}, the music emotion classifier is trained by fine-tuning a pre-trained LM with a classification head on the 200 labeled pieces of the VGMIDI dataset. Different then these two previous works, emotion classification is treated as a multiclass problem instead of a binary one. In this new framing, each of the four quadrants of the circumplex model are mapped to a label.

MCTS is evaluated with two listening tests (human evaluations), one to measure the quality of the generated pieces and one to measure MCTS's accuracy in generating pieces with a target emotion. In the first test, listeners are asked to prefer among MCTS, the validation data (human compositions), TopK sampling and SBBS \cite{ferreira2020computer}. In the second study, listeners are asked to annotate the emotion of pieces generated by MCTS, TopK sampling, and SBBS. Results showed that MCTS outperforms SBBS in terms of music quality while keeping the same accuracy when conveying target emotions. An expressivity analysis \cite{smith2010analyzing} has been performed to better understand how MCTS is conveying each target emotion. The frequencies of pitch classes and note durations suggest that MCTS can reproduce some common composition practices used by human composers.

% \section{Language and Emotion Models}

% In this section we describe the language and emotion models used to guide the generation of music with perceived emotion.

\section{Language Model}

Music Transformer (MT) \cite{huang2018music} is currently one of the state-of-the-art methods for symbolic music generation and hence it is used as a base LM for MCTS. This MT LM is trained on the unlabelled pieces of the VGMIDI dataset. Originally, the VGMIDI dataset had 728 unlabelled pieces, but it has been expanded to 3,640 pieces in this work. The new pieces are piano arrangements of video game music created by the NinSheetMusic community\footnote{\url{https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/}}. The VGMIDI dataset has been used, as opposed to MAESTRO \cite{hawthorne2018enabling} or other large dataset of symbolic music, to be able to train both the language and emotion models on similar datasets.
The VGMIDI pieces are encoded using a different vocabulary than the original one proposed with MT \cite{huang2018music}. Aiming at reducing the length of the music sequences, the MIDI files are mapped to sequences using a large expressive vocabulary instead of a compact one. To create a sequence from a MIDI file, the starting times of all the notes are discretized into a sequence of time-steps. Then, each time-step is processed in order, generating a token $n_{p, d, v}$ for each note in the time-step. The three parameters of a note token $n_{p, d, v}$ are pitch $p$, duration $d$ and velocity $v$, respectively. In order to constrain the possible combinations of note tokens, the pitch values are limited to $30 \leq p \leq 96$. Duration $d$ is limited by the types: breve, whole, half, quarter, eighth, 16th and 32nd. The dotted versions of these types (maximum of 3 dots) are also considered. Velocities are limited to the values $v \in [32, 36, 40, \cdots, 128]$. After processing each time step, a token $r_d$ is generated representing a rest with a given duration $d$. The token ``$.$'' (period) is included at the end of all time-steps to represent the end of the piece.

This encoding scheme yields a vocabulary with 44,346 tokens. This is orders of magnitude larger than most of the other vocabularies in the literature \cite{briot2017deep}. By having more tokens, MCTS has more options to choose from at any given point of the generative process, which increases the search complexity. On the other hand, it considerably reduce the length of the encoded pieces, which reduces the search complexity. MCTS mitigates the effects of having more options to choose from by only considering the top $k$ tokens according to the LM at any decision point of the generative process. Moreover, according to \citet{holtzman2018learning}, LMs tend to generate less repetitive sequences with larger vocabularies.

% In this work, the probability of a sequence of tokens $s$ according to the LM is denoted as $L(s)$ and the probability of the sequence $s$ added of the token $l$ as $L(s, l)$.

\section{Music Emotion Classifier}
\label{sec:emotion_classifier}

In the previous works presented in this dissertation \cite{ferreira_2019, ferreira2020computer}, it has been shown that fine-tuning a LM with an extra classification head yields a better model than training a classifier from scratch with the same architecture of the LM. A similar approach is used in this work, by fine-tuning a MT instead of an LSTM \cite{ferreira_2019} or a GPT-2 Transformer \cite{ferreira2020computer}. MT is fine-tuned with the labeled pieces of the VGMIDI dataset. In \cite{ferreira_2019, ferreira2020computer}, symbolic music emotion classification is approached as two independent binary problems, one for valence and one for arousal. This work defines it as a multiclass problem. Four ``emotions'' are considered: high valence and arousal (E0), low valence and high arousal (E1), low valence and arousal (E2), and high valence and low arousal (E4). Each labeled piece in the VGMIDI dataset has a valence label $v \in [-1, 1]$ and a arousal label $a \in [-1, 1]$. A pair of values are mapped to a categorical label (E0, E1, E2, or E3) by getting the quadrant in which $(v,a)$ lie in. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:va_mapping}, a piece with values $(1,1)$ is mapped to E0, $(-1,1)$ is mapped to E1, $(-1,-1)$ is mapped to E2 and $(1, -1)$ is mapped to E3.

\begin{figure}

 \caption{Mapping the circumplex model to a categorical model of emotion with four classes: E1, E2, E3, and E4.}
 \label{fig:va_mapping}
\end{figure}

This mapping yields 76 pieces with label E0, 38 with label E1, 27 with label E2, and 59 with E3. This multiclass approach is used to simplify the search task of controlling the emotion of the generated pieces: only a single model as an emotion score, instead of a combination of two. Since MCTS evaluates the emotion of sequences of different lengths (see the detail in Section~\ref{sec:puct}), the emotion model is trained with prefixes of different lengths extracted from the labeled pieces. Thus, during training, the classifier learns a mapping of a sequence to an emotion considering different lengths. This is especially helpful to guide the search at the beginning of the generation process, where the number of generated tokens is short, and so the emotion classifier does not have much context to be confident about a prediction.

% In this work, $E$ denotes the emotion model and $E(s, e)$ the probability of a sequence $s$ being perceived as a piece of emotion $e$.

\section{MCTS for Music Generation}
\label{sec:puct}

% MCTS
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm traditionally used to play board games with large search spaces. Before taking an action at the current game state, MCTS iteratively explores the branches of the search tree, looking ahead to determine how different game moves could lead to stronger or weaker positions of the game. MCTS variations use a variety of algorithms for deciding which branches of the tree to explore next. For example, UCT~\cite{Kocsis2006} uses the UCB1 formula for deciding which branches to expand in each iteration of the algorithm, while AlphaZero uses the PUCT formula~\cite{rosin2011pucb}. This section describes how this work employs PUCT to generate music with a specific target emotion.

PUCT receives a prefix $x = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_t]$ of an existing musical piece as input, which will bias the process; an emotion model $E$; a language model $L$; a set of $k$ symbols that is used to focus the search on the symbols with higher probability according to $L$; a search budget $d$ that defines the amount of search PUCT can perform before adding the next symbol to the musical sequence; and a target perceived emotion $e$. PUCT returns a sequence $x'$ with prefix $x$ for which $E(x', e)$ and $L(x')$ are maximized. PUCT grows a search tree where each node $n$ in the tree represents a sequence of symbols from the vocabulary. The root of the tree represents the prefix $x$ provided as input. Each edge $(n, n')$ from node $n$ to node $n'$ represents the addition of a symbol to the sequence $n$ ($n'$ is one symbol larger than $n$). In this formulation, $n'$ is called a child of $n$, and since each node $n$ represents a sequence $x$, $n$ and $x$ are used interchangeably.

Initially, PUCT's tree is of size one as it only contains the root of the tree. In each iteration, PUCT performs the following steps to add a new node to the tree: (1) selection, (2) expansion, (3) simulation and (4) backpropagation.
% We explain each of these steps and their intuition.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent
\textbf{Selection:} For each node $n$ in the PUCT, the symbol $l$ is selected to maximize Equation \ref{eq:puct},
where $Q(n, l)$ is a value computed based on the emotion model (explained in the simulation and backpropagation steps), $c$ is an exploration constant, $L(n, l)$ is the language model's probability of adding symbol $l$ to the sequence $n$, $N(n)$ is the number of times node $n$ was visited in the selection step, and $N(n, l)$ is the number of times symbol $l$ was chosen at node $n$ in a selection step.
\begin{equation}
\argmax_{l} Q(n, l) + c \times L(n, l) \times \frac{\sqrt{N(n)}}{1 + N(n, l)} \,,
\label{eq:puct}
\end{equation}
\noindent

 In practice, only the $k$ symbols with largest probable value according to the LM are considered in the $\argmax$ operator shown above. This allows the search to focus on sequences that are more promising according to the language model. PUCT recursively selects nodes in the tree according to Equation~\ref{eq:puct} until the symbol $l$ at a node $n$ leads to a sequence whose node $n'$ is not in the PUCT tree.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent
\textbf{Expansion:} The node $n'$ returned in the selection step is then added to the PUCT tree and its statistics are initialized: $N(n') = 1$, $N(n', l) = 0$ and $Q(n', l) = 0$ for all top $k$ symbols $l$ according to the probability $L(n', l)$.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent
\textbf{Simulation:} In this step, the sequence represented in the recently added node $n'$ is evaluated according to the target emotion. The $Q(n, l)$-value (recall that adding $l$ to $n$ generated the node $n'$) is given by $E(n', e)$. The value of $N(n, l) = 1$ as this is the first time $l$ is selected in node $n$.
%Inspired in the scheme employed in AlphaZero~\cite{alphazero},
%instead of adding symbols to the sequence node $n'$ represents until reaching an end-of-music symbol,
%we use $E(n', e)$ as the $Q(n, l)$-value.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent
\textbf{Backpropagation:} The value of $Q(n, l)$ is used to update the $Q$-values of all the other node-symbol pairs selected in the first step of the algorithm. This is achieved by following the path in the tree from the selection step in reverse order and updating the statistics of each node $n$ and node-symbol pairs $(n, l)$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
Q(n, l) &= \frac{Q(n, l) \times N(n, l) + E(n', e)}{N(n, l) + 1} \\
N(n, l) &= N(n, l) + 1 \,.
\end{align*}
The $Q(n, l)$-values are the average $E$-values of sequences with prefix given by $n$. The value of $Q(n, l)$ estimates how continuations of the sequence $n$ added to the symbol $l$ is with respect to the target emotion. The backpropagation step completes an iteration of PUCT.

In the next iteration, PUCT will perform the four steps described above, but with updated values of $N$ and $Q$ for the node-symbol pairs selected in the previous iteration. Equation~\ref{eq:puct} guarantees that the sequences $n$ that maximize the value of $E(n, e)$ are visited more often as they will have larger values of $Q$. The PUCT formula also accounts for the probability given by the language model, giving preference to sequences with higher probability according to $L$. Finally, the term $\frac{\sqrt{N(n)}}{1 + N(n, l)}$ certifies that all nodes have a chance of being explored by the search.
%allows even nodes that are considered unpromising by the language and emotion models to be explored by the search.

PUCT performs $d$ iterations before deciding which symbol will be added to the sequence represented at the root of the tree. That is, the search budget of $d$ iterations is to decide the next symbol of the sequence. Let $n$ be the root of the tree. The symbol $l$ that will be added to the sequence $n$ is sampled from the distribution given by the values $\frac{N(n)}{\sum_{l} N(n, l)}$. The node $n'$ resulting from the addition of $l$ to $n$ becomes the new root of the tree and another PUCT search is performed with budget $d$ to choose the next symbol to be added to $n'$. This process is repeated until the next symbol added is the end-of-music symbol. The PUCT search can be seen as an operator that changes the probability distribution over symbols given by the language model such that it accounts for the target emotion model. This is because the distribution given by $\frac{N(n)}{\sum_{l} N(n, l)}$ will favor symbols that lead to pieces matching the target emotion as nodes representing such pieces are visited more often during search.

\section{Empirical Evaluation}

MCTS is evaluated with two listening tests (user studies), one for measuring the quality of the generated pieces and one for measuring the accuracy in conveying a target emotion. All experiments were performed via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). For both experiments, MCTS is compared against SBBS, TopK sampling, and human composed pieces (from the validation data used with the emotion classifier). MCTS is not compared against \citet{ferreira_2019} because their approach is limited to sentiment. For each model, 10 pieces are generated with 512 tokens for each target emotion $e \in [0, 1, 2, 3]$ (total of 160 pieces). Each model generated 40 pieces with the same set of 40 prime sequences (one prime per piece). Each prime sequence is 32 tokens long and is selected at random from the VGMIDI validation pieces with the target emotion. For the ``human'' model, pieces are ``generated'' by simply extracting the first 512 tokens of the piece with the given prime.

To generate the pieces, a MT LM is first trained with 4 layers (transformer blocks), a maximum sequence length of 2048 tokens, 8 attention heads and an embedding layer with size 384. The size of the Feed-Forward layers in the each transformer block was set to 1024. This LM was trained with the 3640 unlabelled pieces of the extended VGMIDI dataset, where 3094 (85\%) of the pieces were used for training and 546 (15\%) for testing. All unlabelled pieces were augmented by (a) transposing to every key, (b) increasing and decreasing the tempo by 10\% and (c) increasing and decreasing the velocity of all notes in by 10\% \cite{oore2017learning}. The emotion classifier is then trained by fine-tuning the MT LM with an extra classification head on top. The emotion classifier was trained with the 200 labelled pieces of the VGMIDI dataset, where 140 (70\%) pieces were used for training and 30 (30\%) for testing. After training, the losses of the MT LM are 0.54 (training set) and 0.73 (validation set). The validation accuracy of the emotion classifier is 61\%. During generation time, the LM distribution is filtered with $k = 128$ in MCTS, SBBS and TopK. The number of beams for SBBS was set to $b = 4$. For MCTS, the number of simulation steps set was set to $30$ and the exploration weight to $16$.

\subsection{Quality Listening Test}

In the quality listening test, a pairwise comparison is performed similar to the human evaluation in \cite{huang2018music}. Human subjects were presented with two generated pieces from two different models that were given the same priming sequence. The two pieces were presented side-by-side and the human subjects were asked to select which one is more musical using a 5-point Likert scale. In this scale, 1 means "Left piece is much more musical", 2 means "Left piece is slightly more musical", 3 means "Tie", 4 means "Right piece is slightly more musical" and 5 means "Right piece is much more musical". The order of the two pieces was randomized to avoid ordering bias. Each of the 240 pairs of generated pieces were evaluated by 3 MTurk workers. In order to reduce noise in the results (mainly caused by random choices in Amazon MTurk), a test evaluation is included for each human subject. This test is another pair of pieces to be evaluated with the same Likert scale, but one piece is a human composed piece and the other one is sampled from the LM without TopK filtering and temperature equal to 1.5 (forcing the sample to have poor quality). The subjects are also asked to briefly justify their choice with 1-3 short sentences. Participants who failed the test evaluation (choosing the sampled piece as more musical) or didn't write explanations longer than 5 words were filtered out. In total, this experiment yielded 389 comparisons. Each pair was evaluated at least once.

Table \ref{tab:quality} shows the results of the quality test. The top part of the table shows the number of wins, ties and losses of one model against another.  MCTS performed exactly like TopK sampling and outperformed SBBS by ten wins. Surprisingly, MCTS won against human composed pieces 12 times and tied 9 times. SBBS performed worse than TopK sampling, winning 26 times and loosing 31. As expected, all models performed worse than human compositions. The bottom part of the table shows the percentage of wins, ties and losses for one model against all other models. Percentages are reported because, due the filtering of the participants, the amount of comparisons for each model is not the same. The aggregated results also show that MCTS performs better than SBBS and the same as TopK sampling. A Kruskal-Wallis H test of the subject choices (values from 1 to 5) shows that there is a statistically significant difference between the models with p = 1.5e-4 < 0.01.

\end{table}

\subsection{Emotion Listening Test}

In the emotion listening test, human subjects were asked to annotate the generated pieces according to the circumplex model of emotion using the same tool designed to annotate the VGMIDI dataset \cite{ferreira_2019}. An annotation result is a time series of valence-arousal pairs where each element corresponds to a chunk (a bar if the piece has 4/4 time signature) of the piece. For this experiment, 3 MTurk workers were assigned for each piece generated by the MCTS, SBBS, and TopK methods (total of 360 annotations). Human pieces are not reannotated because they are the ground truth data used to train the emotion classification model that is base for both MCTS and SBBS. No annotations were filtered out in this experiment.

The accuracy of a method in conveying a target emotion is measured with the percentage of chunks in the annotations that match the target emotion. Each valence-arousal pair is mapped to an emotion label by getting the quadrant of that valence-arousal pair (see Section \ref{sec:emotion_classifier} for details).  Table \ref{tab:emotion} reports the accuracy of each model for each emotion. Overall, MCTS outperformed TopK (no emotion control) by an average of 15\%. MCTS performed very similar to SBBS, with slightly better average accuracy. However, it is important to highlight that MCTS was able to considerably improve the accuracy in conveying the two least represented emotions (E1 and E2) in the VGMIDI dataset. This is an important results since labelling symbolic music according to emotion is a very expensive task.

    \caption{Accuracy of each model in conveying the target emotions E0, E1, E2 and E3. }
    \label{tab:emotion}
\end{table}

TopK performed reasonably well on average (39\%), however, this was primarily due to its ability to convey the two most represented emotions in the training data (E0 and E3). These two emotions very likely are more represented in the unlabelled data as well, which was used to train the LM. Moreover, even though TopK sampling does not control emotion, the prime sequences they used to generate the pieces had the target emotions. Thus, TopK (like all other models) is conditioned with this prime sequence towards the desired emotion. However, because TopK does not consider emotion when generating pieces, eventually it starts sampling tokens that deviate from the target emotion.

Although MCTS performed similarly to SBBS in terms of emotion, MCTS outperformed SBBS considerably with respect to music quality. One reason for SBBS being as good as MCTS at conveying emotions is that SBBS tends to generate repetitive pieces once that maximizes both the probabilities of the language model and the emotion model. Since SBBS doesn't do backtracking, when it generates a good pattern that is likely and that conveys the target emotion, it tends to repeat that pattern.

Figure \ref{fig:ex_pieces} illustrates this problem with examples of pieces generated by MCTS and SBBS. These two pieces were given the same prime sequence with the target emotion E2 (low valence and arousal). The MCTS piece develops the prime sequence exploring mainly the final part of the prime sequence. The generated continuation is formed by two different sections and each section is repeated once. The SBBS piece, on the other hand, simply repeats the final part of the prime sequence until the end of the piece. This is a case where SBBS repeated a given pattern that maximized the probability of the language model and the emotion model. This example also shows how backtracking allows MCTS to look for different patterns in the search space.

\section{Expressivity Range}

An expressivity analysis is performed to better understand how MCTS is conveying the different target emotions. Expressivity analysis is an evaluation method commonly used in the AI and Games research community to compare different level generators \cite{smith2010analyzing}.  It consists of generating a large set of levels and measuring the biases of the generators according to pre-defined relevant metrics. In the music generation domain,  this approach is used to explore the biases of the MCTS generator when conveying each emotion with respect to human compositions.

% TODO: Compare with human expressivity (maybe run a statistical tests)
The expressivity analysis is performed on the 40 pieces generated by MCTS for the previous experiments, considering the frequencies of pitch and duration as the metrics to measure bias. Figure \ref{fig:expressivity} illustrates the distribution of pitch classes and duration types for both MCTS and Human composed pieces. Overall, the MCTS and Human distributions of note durations look similar. For label E0 (high valence and arousal), Human pieces predominantly have 16th notes, but a few 8th notes are also present. Quarter notes and 32nd notes are rarely used. MCTS also explored mainly 16th notes in label E0, however it used considerably more 8th and 32nd notes. Label E0 encapsulates emotions such as Happy, Delighted and Excited. These results show that both VGMIDI pieces and MCTS generated pieces with these emotions have rhythm patterns with shorter notes.
% In terms of pitch classes, MCTS used mainly C, C\#, D, E, and A to control pieces in E0.

% TODO: discuss pitch usage
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{imgs/ismir21/mcts_human.png}
   \caption{MCTS expressivity range. The x axis represents note duration in seconds and the y axis represents pitch classes. }
 \label{fig:expressivity}
\end{figure}

For label E1 (low valence and high arousal), human compositions have a more even distribution between 16th notes and 8th notes. Quarter notes are present but in a considerably lower frequency and 32nd notes are rarely used. MCTS also used a combination of 16th and 8th notes, but less quarter notes and a little more 32nd notes.
% With respect to pitch classes, MCTS used mainly C D and F. Compared to E0, the variance of note durations and pitches is much lower in E1.
Label E1 represents emotions such as Tense, Angry and Frustrated. Combining these results with the expressivity range of label E0, one concludes that, VGMIDI and MCTS music with high valence have rhythm patterns with notes shorter than a quarter note.
% Thus, These results show that, in the VGMIDI dataset, music with these emotions typically uses repetition (as in the ``Jaws'' theme) to create tension in the listener.

For label E2 (low valence and arousal), human  pieces are mainly composed of quarter notes. Pieces with this label also have a few 8th and 16th notes. Different than E0 and E1, E2 has a few longer notes such as half, whole and breve notes. When generating pieces with emotion E2, MCTS also focused on quarter notes. However, compared with human pieces, more shorter notes were used and less longer notes were used. Label E2 encapsulates emotions such as Sad, Depressed and Tired. According to these results, human composed music as well as pieces generated by MCTS on this space tend to have rhythm patters with longer notes.

% This is also an expected result since  Music in this space tends to have a slow tempo and rhythm patterns with long notes. For E2, the pitch classes G, A, and B were the most frequent ones.

For label E3 (high valence and low arousal), human pieces as well as generated pieces have manly 8th notes with a few 16h, quarter and whole notes.  These pieces represent emotions such as Calm, Relaxed, and Content. With these results of expressivity, one concludes that pieces with low arousal have rhythm patters with longer notes.

% In video game music, Calm music (such as the "Sims" theme) tends not to be very slow once the game wants to keep the player engaged. Thus, having this wide combination of durations centered around dotted 8th notes seems a good choice.

\section{Conclusions}

This paper applied MCTS to generate symbolic music with controllable emotion. MCTS used PUCT to explore the search tree, where the probability of the nodes comes from a music LM, and their scores are given by an emotion classifier. A categorical model of emotion was used with four labels: high valence and arousal, low valence and high arousal, low valence and arousal, and high valence and low arousal. MCTS was evaluated with two listening tests, one to measure the quality of the generated pieces and one to measure its accuracy in conveying target emotions. A pairwise comparison is performed in the first experiment between pieces generated by MCTS, SBBS, TopK sampling, and human composers. Human subjects were asked to rate which pieces they found more musical. In the second experiment, human subjects annotated the generated pieces according to the proposed model of emotion to evaluate if human subjects can perceive the emotions intended by MCTS. Results showed that MCTS outperforms SBBS in terms of quality and has slightly better accuracy when controlling emotions. With an expressivity analysis, it has been shown that MCTS generates pieces with music features similar to human compositions.

To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work to apply MCTS as an algorithm to decode neural LMs. Moreover, this is the first time MCTS is being used to control emotions in generated symbolic music. Given that MCTS is agnostic to the classifier used to steer the distribution of the LM, it can be used to control different features of music that a classifier can discriminate. Since MCTS used a large vocabulary with approximately 45K tokens to generate music, its generative task is similar to other NLP generative tasks. Therefore, MCTS can also be generalized to decode and control LMs in text generation domain.
